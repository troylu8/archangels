- altar: put first tri at 90 +- ( (theta / 2) + 120 )   

insight:

Graphics objects are like an infinite size sheet of paper, can rotate and move around

to convert vector components to theta, use atan( y / x)
if x is negative, it will give the opposite angle. so, add Math.PI to the result if necessary
